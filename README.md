# spotify-rs
spotify-rs is a Rust wrapper for the Spotify API.

Currently, it only supports the album-related [endpoints](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-an-album). More will be added in the near future. The library is in its infancy and breaking changes will happen. Any feedback is appreciated.
