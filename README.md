# spotify-rs
spotify-rs is a Rust wrapper for the Spotify API.

Currently, it only supports the following endpoints:

- album-related
- artist-related
- audiobook-related
- category-related

More will be added in the near future. The library is in its infancy and breaking changes will occur. Any feedback is appreciated.
