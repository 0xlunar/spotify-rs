# spotify-rs
spotify-rs is a Rust wrapper for the Spotify API.

Currently, the following endpoints are missing:
- player
- tracks
- users

More will be added in the near future. The library is in its infancy and breaking changes will occur.

Documentation will be added once full API coverage is achieved (not much left!).

Any feedback is appreciated.
